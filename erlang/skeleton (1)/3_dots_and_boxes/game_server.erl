% Short discription: This module is the implementation of the gen_server of a game called room

% If a move of a player is made this function starts working, it doesnt work quite yet. This is
% as far as I know for two reasons, one, the score is not calculated correctly by the functions
% two, line 48 that terminates the server if the game is finished terminates the server.
% This function handles the move of the player by the rules of the game (search google).
% The function doesnÂ´t keep track of the overall score
